# MemSysExplorer: Memory Array Characterization

Memory array characterization in MemSysExplorer is performed using an extended version of the [NVSim](https://github.com/SEAL-UCSB/NVSim) framework for broader embedded memory Design Space Exploration (DSE). It incorporates features and models from [NVSim](https://github.com/SEAL-UCSB/NVSim), [NVMExplorer](https://github.com/lpentecost/NVMExplorer), [DESTINY](https://code.ornl.gov/3d_cache_modeling_tool/destiny), and [NeuroSim](https://github.com/neurosim/DNN_NeuroSim_V1.4), and has been extended (2025) to include emerging transistor technologies and additional embedded DRAM (eDRAM) memory cell architectures (for example, 3 Transistor (3T) eDRAMs with mixed-threshold voltages).

- **Device Engineering Flexibility for Mixed-VT eDRAM**
    - Assign different transistor types (HP/LP) and process nodes for:
        - Peripherals (e.g., sense amps/decoders)
        - Write path (e.g., low-leakage/alternative node)
        - Read path (e.g., high-speed/alternative node)
    - For example:
        - High performance transistors for peripherals
        - Low leakage transistors for write path
        - High performance transistors for read path
- **Advanced Technology Nodes**
    - Includes advanced finFET nodes and experimental beyond-silicon technologies. Technology models ported and updated from NVSim and NeuroSim. For emerging devices (e.g., IGZO, CNFET), models are calibrated from academic sources:
        - Nodes above 22 nm are calibrated to the Predictive Technology Model ([PTM](https://mec.umn.edu/ptm)) Project as in [Neurosim](https://github.com/neurosim/DNN_NeuroSim_V1.4)
        - The 10 nm node is calibrated to IRDS 2016 as in [Neurosim](https://github.com/neurosim/DNN_NeuroSim_V1.4)
        - Silicon Technology nodes below 10 nm are calibrated to IRDS 2021 as in [Neurosim](https://github.com/neurosim/DNN_NeuroSim_V1.4)
        - Examples of beyond silicon transistor technologies for eDRAM such as indium-gallium-zinc-oxide transistors with gate length 45nm and carbon nanotube field effect transistors with gate length 22nm are calibrated to experimental data as in [333-eDRAM](https://62dac.conference-program.com/presentation/?id=RESEARCH2286&sess=sess124)
- **Bit Cell Configurations**
    - Each configuration references a sample cell calibrated to physical layouts from literature and specifications from industry. For SRAM and eDRAM, the following references were used:

## Compilation
**MemSysExplorer** is programmed in GNU C++. It can be compiled on both Unix-like OSes and Microsoft Windows. Under Linux, the tool can be built using `make`. 
```
make
```
Running `make` will automatically set the required compiler flags.


## Running Simulations
Example configuration files are provided in the sample_configs folder. Each configuration in sample_configs references a cell in the sample_cells folder. Each sample cell has been calibrated to published physical memory cell layouts/specifications from academia & industry. Run Simulations using the following command:

```
./nvsim sample_configs/<chosen_config>.cfg
```
## Example for 333-eDRAM
In addition to the configuration existing configuration parameters in NVSIM, MemSysExplorer adds the following additional parameters for 3T-eDRAMs.

```
-MemoryCellInputFile: sample_cells/sample_edram3t_333/sample_eDRAM3T_333eDRAM.cell

-ProcessNode: 7
-DeviceRoadmap: LOP

-ProcessNodeR: 22
-DeviceRoadmapR: CNT

-ProcessNodeW: 45
-DeviceRoadmapW: IGZO

```

Where `ProcessNode` is the process node of the peripherals, `ProcessNodeR` is the process node of the eDRAM cell read path, and `ProcessNodeW` is the process node of the eDRAM cell write path. In the example above, we are using 7 nm peripherals, CNFETs for the read path and IGZO FETs for the write path. The `MemoryCellInputFile` selects the parameters for the memory cell configuration. For example,
```
-MemCellType: eDRAM3T333

-CellArea (F^2): 387.76
-CellAspectRatio: 1.06

-ReadMode: voltage

-AccessType: CMOS
-AccessCMOSWidth (F): 1.64
-AccessCMOSWidthR (F): 3.6

-DRAMCellCapacitance (F): 0.5e-15
-ResetVoltage (V): vdd
-SetVoltage (V): vdd

-MinSenseVoltage (mV): 10
-MaxStorageNodeDrop (V): 0.1

-RetentionTime (us): 501
```

In NVSim, the feature size, is equal to the process node. For example the feature size is 7 nm at the 7 nm node. The feature size for the `CellArea` parameter is equal to the feature size of the peripherals. The read path (`AccessCMOSWidthR`) and write path (`AccessCMOSWidth`) transistor widths are calculated using the feature size of the technology for those transistors. For example, 1.64 $\times$ 45 nm for IGZO and 3.6 $\times$ 22 nm for CNFET. `DRAMCellCapacitance` specifies the capacitance of the storage node used in retention time calculations. `MinSenseVoltage` specifies the minimum voltage required for the sense amplifier to detect the correct voltage level.`MaxStorageNodeDrop` specifies the maximum voltage drop in storage node voltage before data loss. For 3T eDRAMs, it is desirable to have a small storage node voltage drop to maintain read speed, since the read speed is a function of the storage node voltage. 

When retention time is given using the `RetentionTime` flag, MemSysExplorer uses this value directly. If `RetentionTime` is not provided, MemSysExplorer calculated nominal retention time using C $\times$ $\Delta$ V / Ioff, where C is the storage node capacitance, $\Delta$ V is the maximum storage node drop, and Ioff is the subthreshold leakage of the write path transistor. Process variations can be studied using [msxfi](msxFI). 

For memories leveraging monolithic 3D integration (e.g., 333-eDRAM) where the memory cell array is fabricated directly above the peripherals, the peripherals are first pitch matched to the array and then the area of the memory cells is subtracted from the final subarray area.
